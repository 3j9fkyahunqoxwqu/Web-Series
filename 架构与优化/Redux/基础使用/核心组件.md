# 核心组件

Redux 的整个系统图解可以参考下图：

- Store - an object that keeps whole the state of our application

- Actions - plain objects representing the facts about “what happened” in our app

- Reducers - pure functions updating the state according to actions

All this staff responds to the side of logic. Let's look further... What's about view? There are two types of components:

- Container - "smart" components,which are concerned with "how things work"

- Presentational -"dumb" components,which are concerned with "how things look"
