# React Native 启动流程

# 线程模型

When a React Native application is launched, it spawns up the following threading queues.

- Main thread (Native Queue) - This is the main thread which gets spawned as soon as the application launches. It loads the app and starts the JS thread to execute the Javascript code. The native thread also listens to the UI events like 'press', 'touch', etc. These events are then passed to the JS thread via the RN Bridge. Once the Javascript loads, the JS thread sends the information on what needs to be rendered onto the screen. This information is used by a shadow node thread to compute the layouts. The shadow thread is basically like a mathematical engine which finally decides on how to compute the view positions. These instructions are then passed back to the main thread to render the view.

- Javascript thread (JS Queue) - The Javascript Queue is the thread queue where main bundled JS thread runs. The JS thread runs all the business logic, i.e., the code we write in React Native.

- Custom Native Modules - Apart from the threads spawned by React Native, we can also spawn threads on the custom native modules we build to speed up the performance of the application. For example - Animations are handled in React Native by a separate native thread to offload the work from the JS thread.
